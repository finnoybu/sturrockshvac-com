# Contributing Guidelines

This repository contains the official website for Sturrock's HVAC Solutions.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` → Production-ready code
- `dev` → Active development
- Feature branches → `feature/<description>`

Example:
feature/dynamic-appointment-selector

## Commit Message Standard

Use clear, descriptive commits:

- `feat: add dynamic service type dropdown`
- `fix: correct modal CTA routing`
- `style: improve mobile spacing`
- `refactor: clean service data object`
- `docs: update README roadmap`

---

## Versioning

Semantic versioning:

- MAJOR → structural changes

- PATCH → bug fixes

Example:
v0.2.0

## Deployment Policy

All changes should be tested locally before merging.
